## Enhancements

 * Added Assert-That assertion. Going forward, new assertions will be added to this function.
 * When a test tear down function fails, the result object uses the test's name instead of `Stop-Test`

## Bug Fixes

 * Test duration didn't include tear down durations.
 * `Assert-Error` fails when error count is 0.

 
# 0.11.1

 * CruiseControl.NET showing incorrect total test suite duration.
 * Prefixing test case names with fixture name so test results are more readable under CruiseControl.NET.

# 0.11.0

 * Created `Export-RunResultXml` function for exporting test results to an NUNit-compatible XML file.
 * `blade.ps1` saves test results to NUNit-compatible XML files. Use the `Name` and `XmlLogPath` parameters.
