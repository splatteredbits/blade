.SYNOPSIS
Runs Blade tests in a file or set of directories.

.DESCRIPTION
Blade is a simple testing framework, inspired by NUnit.  It reads in all the files under a given path (or paths), and opens each file that matches the `Test-*` pattern.  It will then execute the tests in that file.  Blade tests are functions that that use the `Test` verb in their name, i.e. whose name match the `Test-*` pattern.

When executing the tests in a file, Blade does the following:

 * Calls the `Start-TestFixture` function (if one is defined)
 * Executes each test.  For each test, Blade calls the `Start-Test` function (if defined), followed by the test, followed by the `Stop-Test` function (if defined).
 * Calls the `Stop-TestFixture` function (if one is defined)

Blade will return `Blade.TestResult` objects for all failed tests and a final `Blade.RunResult` object summarizing the results.  Use the `PassThru` switch to also get `Blade.TestResult` objects for passing tests.

You can access the `Blade.RunResult` object from the last test run via the global `LASTBLADERESULT` variable.
